# Project
120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results

Name: Yara Djaidoen
Student Number: 11123117

## Problem:
As I am very fond of sports and I could not find a complete representation of
the statistics/developments/corralations made in the olympic games, I wanted to
make one that does.

## Solution:

I am going to design an interactive map that gives statistics per country on:
* Amount of medals won
* Sports that a country is best at
* How GDP influences the amount of athletes per country that participate and how they performed
* Based on population how well a country does

### Visual sketch
This is a raw sketch of how I would like to visualize the data
![sketch of visulaization](/doc/sketch_1.jpg)

### Main features
#### 1) Minimum Viable Product
A minimum viable product is the product with as least features as possible, which still helps solve the problem for your target audience.
+ A year should be able to be selected
+ At least the map should be interactive. You should be able to select one country and call its statistics.

#### 2) Optional Implementations
This are the parts of your project may be optional to implement or “nice to have”.
+ It would be nice if you could compare two countries and their statistics


## Prerequisites:
### Data sources:
* Data source athletes participation history:
[link to data athletes history](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
* Data source on population per country per year:
[link to data world population](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
* Data source on GDP development per country per year:
[link to data GDP per country](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)

### External components:
I do not know about what libraries I want to use yet, even what D3 can provide in the visualization I am going make.

### Similar:
This is a [link](tohttp://rio2016.thegamma.net/) to a site that has part of the visulaization I would like to do too, exept for the fact that I would like to have a more interactive map of countries that give more information (as described in the features)

### Hardest parts:
I think the hardest part of this problem is to represent the right data at the right moments,
and to have a clear overview of all data so it will be user friendly.
