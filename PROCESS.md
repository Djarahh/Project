# Day 2 (Wednesday 9-1-2019)
Today I started working on my bubble map. I found out that I needed an extra data set with the longitude and latitude of the centre of all the countries in the world. I found one on the following website (http://worldmap.harvard.edu/data/geonode:country_centroids_az8). For the steamgraph I found some code on the following website and made it work on mine. Just not yet with my own data. (https://bl.ocks.org/john-guerra/f898333fb41d69978945d315e7b7980c).
I talked to a TA and we figuered that I should change the format of my data the CSV to a nested JSON. I have not figuered out how to do this yet.

# Day 3 (Thursday 10-1-2019)
I was absent This day due to illness, I did not do anything.

# Day 4 (Friday 11-1-2019)
Today I am going to work on my dataset so I can work with it more easy. After half a day of struggeling I Have finally put my JSON file into the right format in the order of Year -> Countries -> Medals -> Sports and Athletes. Now I am going to make the world map that that is colour dependent on the amount of medals won in a year. I am going to use the year 2016 as reference as it was the year with the most sports and therefore medals won. Furthermore, I have changed my plan to use a map instead of a bubble map (as I forsee lots of difficulties with them).
I asked a question on how to format my nested json file and I have finally figuered out how. I now have a map with colours and the data in each country how many medals there are. After I put in a legend I can now continue with the next visualisations.


# Day 5 (Monday 14-11-2019)
Today I will fix the legend and the colour of the boundries in the map. Also a legend will be made. Furthermore I would like to have the interactivity of the slider and the worldmap fixedd. Then I will start working on the sunburst.
