# Day 2 (Wednesday 9-1-2019)
Today I started working on my bubble map. I found out that I needed an extra data set with the longitude and latitude of the centre of all the countries in the world. I found one on the following website (http://worldmap.harvard.edu/data/geonode:country_centroids_az8). For the steamgraph I found some code on the following website and made it work on mine. Just not yet with my own data. (https://bl.ocks.org/john-guerra/f898333fb41d69978945d315e7b7980c).
I talked to a TA and we figuered that I should change the format of my data the CSV to a nested JSON. I have not figuered out how to do this yet.
